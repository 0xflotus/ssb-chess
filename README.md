# ssb-chess
Correspondence chess built on top of the scuttlebutt platform. More information about scuttlebutt here: https://staltz.com/an-off-grid-social-network.html

The UI is build using electron (https://electron.atom.io/), mithriljs (https://mithril.js.org/) and chessground (https://github.com/ornicar/chessground). Chess moves are validated using scalachessjs (https://github.com/veloce/scalachessjs)

Still a hacky work in progress :P
