# ssb-chess
Correspondence chess built on top of the scuttlebutt platform. More information about scuttlebutt here: https://staltz.com/an-off-grid-social-network.html and [https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/)

It is built to allow it to be integrated into scuttlebutt viewers (such as patchbay and patchwork) so that they can take care of things like discovering friends to play with, etc.

# Installation
ssb-chess is currently integrated into [patchbay](https://www.github.com/ssbc/patchbay). You can find it in the menu at the top right (the blue dot) and then the 'chess' menu item.

# Libraries used
* [Mithriljs](https://mithril.js.org/
* [Chessground](https://github.com/ornicar/chessground) is used for the board and pieces widget and animating the moves.
* [Scalachessjs](https://github.com/veloce/scalachessjs) is used for move validation and check / end condition detection.
